# Python Project

## Description

This Python project consists of three major components: encryption with a random key, port scanning, and file management. This project demonstrates various techniques in Python, including cryptography, network scanning, and file handling.

## Features

1. **Encryption with Random Key:**
   - Implements encryption algorithms to secure data using a randomly generated key.
   - Provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt data securely.

2. **Port Scanning:**
   - Scans specified IP addresses or ranges to identify open ports.
   - Helps in assessing network security and discovering services running on a network.

3. **File Management:**
   - Provides functionality for reading, writing, and managing files.
   - Includes operations such as file creation, deletion, and updating file content.
   - Could also integrate with encryption features to securely handle file data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For implementing encryption algorithms, port scanning, and file management functionalities.
- **[Any Libraries or Tools Used]:** List any libraries or tools used, such as `cryptography` for encryption or `scapy` for network scanning.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
