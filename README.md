# Demon

## Description

This Python project consists of three major components: encryption with a random key, port scanning, and file management. This project demonstrates various techniques in Python, including cryptography, network scanning, and file handling.

## Features

1. **Encryption with Random Key:**
   - Implements encryption algorithms to secure data using a randomly generated key.
   - Provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt data securely.

2. **Port Scanning:**
   - Scans specified IP addresses or ranges to identify open ports.
   - Helps in assessing network security and discovering services running on a network.

3. **File Management:**
   - Provides functionality for reading, writing, and managing files.
   - Includes operations such as file creation, deletion, and updating file content.
   - Could also integrate with encryption features to securely handle file data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For implementing encryption algorithms, port scanning, and file management functionalities.
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `colors`: A custom file for ASCII colors.
  - `random`: For generating random keys.
  - `port_scanner`: A custom file for port scanning functionality.
  - `datetime`: For handling date and time operations.
  - `logo`: A custom file for displaying logos.
  - `extra`: A custom file for additional functionalities.
  - `threading`: For concurrent execution.
  - `subprocess`: For executing shell commands.
  - `keyboard`: For keyboard event handling.
